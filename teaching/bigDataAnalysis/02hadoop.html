## Definition of Big Data
- Big data "size" is a **constantly moving target**; as of 2012 ranging from a few dozen **terabytes(`$10^{12}$` bytes)** to many **zettabytes(`$10^{18}$` bytes)** of data.
- Big data was originally associated with **three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity**. "Variety", "veracity", and **various other "Vs" are added** by some organizations to describe it, a revision challenged by some industry authorities.
- The Vs of big data were often referred to as the **"three Vs", "four Vs", and "five Vs"**.
- A 2018 definition states "Big data is where **parallel computing tools** are needed to handle data and notes", which defined change in **the computer science used**.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## How to process the Big Data
- **Relational database management** systems and desktop **statistical software** packages used to visualize data often have **difficulty** processing and analyzing big data.
- The processing and analysis of big data may require **massively parallel software** running on **tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers**.
- What qualifies as big data varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools.
- For some organizations, facing **hundreds of gigabytes of data** for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take **tens or hundreds of terabytes** before data size becomes a significant consideration.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Architecture of Big Data
- In 2004, Google published a paper on a process called **MapReduce that provides a parallel processing model**, and process huge amounts of data.
- With MapReduce, **queries are split and distributed across parallel nodes and processed in parallel (map step). The results are then gathered and delivered (reduce step)**.
- An implementation of the MapReduce framework was adopted by an **Apache open-source project named Hadoop**.
-  **Apache Spark** was developed in 2012 in response to **limitations in the MapReduce paradigm**, as it **adds in-memory processing and the ability to set up many operations** (not just map followed by reducing).

# Cloud Computing<br />(雲端運算)
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Cloud Computing
- Cloud computing is the **on-demand availability** of 
<figure style="float: right; padding-left:0.3em">
<img src="/images/bigData/cloudComputing.png" alt="cloud computing">
</figure>
computer system resources, especially <b>data storage (cloud storage) and computing power</b>, without direct active management by the user.
- Large clouds often have functions **distributed over multiple locations**, each of which is a [data center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frzVtaNrHU0&t=2s)
- Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a **pay-as-you-go model**.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Definition of Cloud Computing
- **On-demand self-service**: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage,..., etc.
- **Broad network access**: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms.
- **Resource pooling(匯集)**: The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model.
- **Rapid elasticity(彈性)**: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand.
- **Measured service**: Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Deployment models
- **Private Cloud** is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third party, and hosted either internally or externally.
- **Public Cloud** services are considered "public" when they are delivered over the public Internet, and they may be offered as a paid subscription, or free of charge.
- **Hybrid Cloud** is a composition of a public cloud and a private environment, such as a private cloud or on-premises resources, that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models.

# Cloud Service Model
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Cloud Computing Service Model
- Though service-oriented <figure style="float: right; padding-left:0.3em">
	<img src="/images/bigData/serviceModel.png" alt="Sevice Model">
	</figure>
	architecture advocates <b>Everything as a service</b> (with the acronyms EaaS or XaaS, or simply aaS).
- The three standard models per [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) are Infrastructure(基礎設施) as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to abstract various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup, etc.
- Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.
- IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks and software bundles.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Platform as a service (PaaS)
- PaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment.
- In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including an operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and the web server.
- Some integration and data management providers also use specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service).
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Software as a service (SaaS)
- In the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications.
- SaaS is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.
- In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients.
-  Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Value of cloud computing(1/2)
- Cost reductions: Devices, location, and IT skills are required for implementation of projects.
- Device independence: Device and location independence enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they use.
- Maintenance: Maintenance of cloud environment is easier than own data center.
- Multitenancy(多租戶): Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users.
- Performance: Performance is monitored by IT experts from the service provider, and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are constructed using web services as the system interface.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Value of cloud computing(2/2)
- Productivity: Productivity may be increased when multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously, rather than waiting for it to be saved and emailed.
- Availability: Availability improves with the use of multiple redundant sites, which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery.
- Scalability and Elasticity: Scalability and elasticity via dynamic ("on-demand") provisioning of resources on a fine-grained, self-service basis in near real-time, without users having to engineer for peak loads.
- Security: Security can improve due to centralization of data, increased security-focused resources, etc...
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Challenges and Limitations
- One of the main challenges of cloud computing is data security and privacy.
	- Cloud users entrust their sensitive data to third-party providers, who may not have adequate measures to protect it from unauthorized access, breaches, or leaks.
- Another challenge of cloud computing is reduced visibility and control.
	- Cloud users may not have full insight into how their cloud resources are managed, configured, or optimized by their providers.
- In addition, cloud migration is a significant issue. Cloud migration is the process of moving data, or applications from one cloud environment to another the cloud.

# Cloud Security
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Cloud Security Issues
- **Shared responsibility for security**: Generally, the cloud provider is responsible for securing cloud infrastructure and the customer is responsible for protecting its data within the cloud.
- **Data encryption**: Data should be encrypted while at rest, in transit, and in use.
- **User identity and access management**: Customer and IT teams need full understanding of and visibility into network, device, application, and data access.
- **Collaborative management**: Proper communication and clear, understandable processes between IT.
- **Security and compliance monitoring**
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Security and Privacy(1/2)
- Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or delete information.
- Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order without a warrant.
- That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services.
- Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.
- Identity management systems can also provide practical solutions to privacy concerns in cloud computing.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Security and Privacy(2/2)
- According to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are **Insecure Interfaces** and **APIs, Data Loss & Leakage**, and **Hardware Failure**—which accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively.
- There is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.
- Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off-site and under someone else's control (public cloud).

# Programming models and systems
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Programming models(1/5) 
- They are, **MapReduce, workflow, Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP), message passing, and SQL-like**, the most popular programming models for Big Data analysis and their major associated software frameworks.
- MapReduce
	- MapReduce is a programming model inspired by functional programming. It is based on the parallel execution of map and reduce functions for designing large-scale
	data-intensive applications.
	- Specifically, the distributed execution of a MapReduce application is delegated to a set of mapper and reducer processes.
</script></section>
<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Programming models(1/5)
- Workflow
	- A workflow is a well defined, and possibly repeatable, pattern designed to achieve a certain transformation of data, usually programmed as a graph.
